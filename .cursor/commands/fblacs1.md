UI / DESIGN RULE — FBLA BRAND COLORS

This project must strictly follow the official FBLA brand color scheme.

Primary Colors:
- FBLA Navy: #0A2E7F (primary backgrounds, headers, nav bars)
- FBLA Blue: #1D52BC (secondary backgrounds, cards, links)
- FBLA Gold: #F4AB19 (CTAs, highlights, active states)

Supporting Colors:
- Cobalt Blue: #226ADD (icons, subtle accents)
- White: #FFFFFF (main backgrounds, cards)
- Black/Dark Gray: #2D2B2B (primary text)

Rules:
- Do NOT introduce random or trendy colors.
- Gold (#F4AB19) is used sparingly for emphasis and calls-to-action only.
- Maintain high contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum).
- Default UI style should be clean, modern, and professional.
- If unsure, prefer Navy + White with Gold accents.

All UI components, themes, and generated styles must comply with this palette.
